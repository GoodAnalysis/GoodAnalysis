## Hi there  
I’m **Kyle Monk**, a technology, insight and product delivery director building data platforms, AI-driven insight tools, and integrated SaaS systems. My work tends to blend **engineering**, **product**, and **market intelligence**, turning complex data into scalable products, or building intelligence or data viz principles into 'dumb' products, predominantly for enterprise and non-profit organisations.

Through **[Good Analysis](https://goodanalysis.co.uk)**, I design, build, and deploy modern software and data infrastructure. I do so mostly with Python, SQL, Next.js, and cloud-native workflows.

### 🔧 What I’m working on  
- **Institute of Commerce** — a full-stack membership and intelligence platform covering learning, CPD, careers, news, and supplier tools.  
- **Good Analysis pipelines** — Market intelligence using modular data ingestion, content processing, and analytics systems powering dashboards and automated insight products.  
- **AI-enabled insight platform** — Combining vector search, Python automation, and cloud deployment to give a client real-time intelligence.

### 🎯 How I work  
- Learned to code later in my career, have moved from research through to strategy and now do those two + product.
- If I can get excited about a project, i'll deliver wonderful things.
- Clean architecture, clear data flows, reliable automation, and products that scale.  
- I have worn many hats, and am often hired as the bridge between commercial and technical teams.
- Linear to organise my life and work. Nothing better for PM.
- Github for version control of all my projects on private repos.
