Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Kyle Monk, a strategist, analyst, and developer building systems that connect insight, strategy, and technology.

Through Good Analysis, I design and develop end-to-end solutions for organisations that need to understand markets, engage audiences, and operate more efficiently â€” from commerce ecosystems to non-profit platforms.

ðŸ’¼ What Iâ€™m working on
	â€¢	Institute of Commerce â€” relaunching the UKâ€™s professional body for commerce with an integrated platform for membership, market intelligence, training, and jobs.
	â€¢	Good Analysis â€” building modular data and content pipelines that power modern insight tools, dashboards, and publication systems.
	â€¢	Non-profit technology â€” creating low-cost, all-in-one platforms that combine websites, CRMs, and analytics for small organisations.

ðŸ§  What I work with
	â€¢	Languages: TypeScript, Python, SQL, Markdown
	â€¢	Frameworks: Next.js, React, Supabase, Node, Vercel, Railway
	â€¢	Focus: data pipelines, automation, membership systems, AI-assisted insight generation

ðŸš€ What drives me

I believe strategic insight should be actionable and accessible â€” not locked in PDFs or spreadsheets.
My work blends commercial analysis with product design to help organisations see, decide, and act faster.
