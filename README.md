## Hi there  
I’m **Kyle Monk**, a technology, insight and product delivery director building data platforms, AI-driven insight tools, and integrated SaaS systems. My work tends to blend **engineering**, **product**, and **market intelligence**, turning complex data into scalable products, or building intelligence principles into 'dumb products, predominantly for enterprise and non-profit organisations.

Through **[Good Analysis](https://goodanalysis.co.uk)**, I design, build, and deploy modern software and data infrastructure. I do so mostly with Python, SQL, Next.js, and cloud-native workflows.

### 🎯 How I work  
I learned to code later in life, have moved from research through to strategy and now execution. 
I use Linear to organise my life and work.
I like building cool things. 
Clean architecture, clear data flows, reliable automation, and products that scale.  
I have worn many hats, and am often hired as the bridge between commercial and technical teams.
